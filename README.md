## The Idea Behind Interpaedia
When I started working on Interpaedia, it was an attempt
to create a source of knowledge, that would be both nice
to look at and fun to read. Interpaedia's goal is not to
present bare facts (as the most of online sources do) but
to provide a deep intuitive understanding of the world
around us.

## Left To Do
Now, Interpaedia is built in the same way a presentations
are. However this linear sorting isn't suitable for such
a big bunch of data. A way better job could be done using
linked modules written by various programmers-artists.
Those links could be even user-driven, as in Paul Otlet's
vision of Mundaneum.
